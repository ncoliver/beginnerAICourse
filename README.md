# 🤖 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Mini Course

Welcome to the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) mini-course!
This course is designed to help you build a strong foundation in AI and Machine Learning (ML) through a mix of lessons, video presentations, and hands-on walkthroughs — all leading up to a practical capstone project.

### 📘 Course Overview

In this course, you’ll learn what Artificial Intelligence is, how machines learn from data, and how AI powers real-world technologies.
We’ll cover the two core types of Machine Learning:

* 🧠 Supervised Learning — Training models using labeled data to make predictions.

* 🔍 Unsupervised Learning — Finding hidden patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.

By the end, you’ll understand how AI “thinks,” makes decisions, and impacts industries across the globe.

### 🧭 Course Structure

The course is divided into three main sections for a smooth, engaging learning flow:

1. Lessons

Learn the fundamentals of AI and ML through concise, easy-to-follow lessons.
Each lesson introduces key terminology, processes, and industry-specific use cases to help you build context and confidence.

2. Video Presentations

Engaging videos bring abstract concepts to life with visuals, examples, and explanations.
These sessions connect theory to real-world practice, helping you understand how AI applies across different domains.

3. Walkthroughs

Step-by-step coding and concept walkthroughs show you how AI works in action.
You’ll experiment with both supervised and unsupervised learning, exploring goals, strategies, and real-world applications.

### 🧩 Capstone Project

Your journey concludes with a capstone project — your opportunity to apply everything you’ve learned.
You’ll choose a dataset and design either a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model to analyze it.
This project demonstrates your understanding and creativity in solving real-world problems with AI.

### 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this course, you will:

- Understand the foundations of AI and Machine Learning.
